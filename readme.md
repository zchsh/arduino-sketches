# Overview

This is a project I'm using to play around with Arduino boards.

## Initial Setup for Espressif ESP32 Board

- Download Arduino IDE
- Add the "Board Manager" for the Espressif ESP32

  - Open the Arduino IDE
  - Under `Preferences` / `Additional Boards Manager URLs`
  - https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

- **Note**: There's an [example guide](https://electricnoodlebox.com/tutorials/esp32-ttgo-dev-board-with-oled-display-tutorial/) that Carlos recommend, that could be worth trying.
